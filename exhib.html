              <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, <b>‘The Sky Above Us’</b>, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.</p>

              <p>Follow the <b>journey of our solar exploration:</b> from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                  <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. <b>Where do we come from and how did we get here?</b> Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.

                  <hr>
                  <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to <b> meet a few of the creatures </b> who didn’t survive, including our <b> Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs </b> too.

                    <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the <b> great wonders of the tiny world.</b>

                    <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.

                    <hr>
                    <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from <b> observing animals </b> in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                    <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
